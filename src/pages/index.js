    <p>I'm Rein! I'm sort of a newbie here, I'm a graphic and web designer by profession but I do some 
    programming at times too on my personal time. I've always wanted to join a hackathon but never really had the chance to,
    but then here comes JAMStack, I'm looking forward to this event, hoping to learn more and broaden my horizons in programming. :)</p>
